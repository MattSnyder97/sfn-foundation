My pediatrician when I was 7 said it was just \"growing pains.\" In 2023, I finally got diagnosed with small fiber neuropathy, which was then idiopathic, so they couldn't find the cause. \n\nDoctors didn't seem determined to help and insisted that I'm young and can bounce back. I kept pushing for answers, and a year later, at my request, I got a biopsy of my lip and was diagnosed with Sj√∂gren's. My lifelong fatigue and neuropathy finally made sense."`
