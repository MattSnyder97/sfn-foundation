          Some people experience symptoms that are patchy, asymmetric, migratory, or involve the face, trunk, or proximal limbs
          (non–length-dependent, or NLD). These NLD symptoms are more common in immune-mediated causes like Sjögren syndrome or sarcoidosis.

          While many people experience symptoms in a symmetric, length-dependent pattern, others may have symptoms that are patchy, 
          intermittent, migratory, or affect areas like the face, trunk, or one side of the body. These non–length-dependent symptoms can
