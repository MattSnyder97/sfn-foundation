By the next day I had all kinds of sharp and bee sting pains that migrated all over but especially hurt my feet, legs and hands. The nurses at the camp said I was just homesick. I cried but I knew I'd be OK because as soon as I got home, I could go to the doctor's and they would sort this all out. I was so naïve.",

          text: `Of course, the doctors didn't know what to do with me. When they found nothing they insisted it was growing pains, anxiety or my favorite, I was just attention-seeking.
          One helpful doctor suggested it could be neuropathy but I didn't have diabetes so it didn't fit. I learned quickly that doctors knew a lot less than I had thought and wouldn't be the saviors I was taught to believe they were. It took until I was fifteen to get a diagnosis of SFN and not because a particular doctor I ran into took the time or energy to look further into my case. I was lucky, as even fewer people knew about SFN back then, but a family friend recommended I get a skin biopsy.`,

          text: `I was thrilled at first. But then they tested me with an antibody panel, and I was negative. I tried oral prednisone and it had no effect on me. I was told it couldn't be autoimmune so therefore it was idiopathic and there was nothing they could do for me. I was sent to pain management where I trialed many typical and less typical drugs and treatments but I am still looking for one that will help me to do this day.
          By then I had developed GI symptoms which were later diagnosed as gastroparesis and dysautonomia. I had started losing my hair and was diagnosed with alopecia areata. These are all symptoms I now believe are related to my SFN.

          I knew pushing through would be worth it. I was going to become a scientist to help find better treatments and someday a cure for people like me. Again, I was so naïve.

Few know about SFN and few have deemed it worthy of study. In fact, no lab in my undergrad institution or my grad institution ( a large state school!) is studying any type of neuropathy let alone SFN. Only a few niche labs across the country are studying it and at least for now I am required to study something else, something that albeit fascinating, is still rarer than SFN. `,

          It is unfair and unacceptable that millions with SFN and related conditions are ignored. I hope one day, with the help of this new organization, this changes. Maybe, one day I will even have the chance to apply the skills I have developed to study SFN in the lab.
