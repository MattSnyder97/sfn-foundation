          reading this, I never expected to be dealing with Small Fiber Neuropathy 
          at such a young age. My journey with SFN started in early 2024, and it's 
          been a challenging path of symptoms, diagnosis, and learning to navigate 
          life with a chronic condition.`,

          condition can be, especially when you're first experiencing symptoms and 
          don't know what's happening to your body. If my experience can help even 
          one person feel less alone or get answers sooner, then it's worth sharing.`,

          text: `In February 2024, I started taking Finasteride for hair loss. It seemed 
          like a simple solution to a common problem. Within just one week, I began 
          experiencing intense burning pain in my calves. At first, I thought maybe 
          I had overdone it at the gym or pulled something, but the pain was unlike 
          anything I'd experienced before.`,

          entire body. The burning pain was now accompanied by shooting pains. Simple activities became challenging, and 
          sleep became elusive as the symptoms seemed to worsen at night.`,

          text: `The progression didn't stop there. In November 2024, I was diagnosed 
          with Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE), a throat condition that made swallowing 
          difficult. Then, in May 2025, I developed full-body tremors that added 
          another layer of complexity to my daily life.`,

          persistence. All of these new symptoms were difficult to describe 
          to doctors, and initial tests often came back normal. It's frustrating 
          when you know something is seriously wrong but can't get clear answers.`,

          punch biopsy. This small procedure confirmed what I had begun to suspect...small fiber neuropathy.
          Having a diagnosis was both a relief and a new 
          challenge. Finally, I knew what was wrong, but now I had to figure out 
          how to manage it.`,
