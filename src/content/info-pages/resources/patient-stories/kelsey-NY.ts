          text: `Kelsey was born on April 10, 1993. Doctors called her a colicky baby because she cried often for 
no apparent reason. Later we’d learn that whenever Kelsey urinated, it burned. She thought this 
was normal because she had never experienced anything different. UTI’s and what we called 
“flare-ups” became the norm. A “flare-up” meant that her vaginal area felt like it was on fire. 
This painful symptom could last for days and began affecting her life. She’d have to abandon her 
softball team during a game, miss out on a friend’s birthday party, or a holiday could be ruined 
without warning. Urologists and gynecologists offered no explanation or solutions.`,

          text: `It was 2009. Kelsey was 16. I was constantly on the computer researching her symptoms. One 
day I read an article about something called vulvodynia. When I read the description, I was 
dumbfounded. Why had no doctor ever mentioned this to us?`,

          text: `Vulvodynia is defined as chronic pain in the vulva region with no apparent cause that lasts for 
three or more months. Any pressure on this area like sitting for too long or wearing tight clothes 
can provoke pain. Women describe the sensation as burning, stinging, or stabbing. It can also 
cause burning urination.`,

          type: "paragraph",
          text: `I knew without a doubt that this was what Kelsey had. We anxiously waited for an appointment 
with a vulvodynia specialist. After a lifetime of wondering, it took a 5-minute exam for him to 
diagnose Kelsey with Primary Vestibulodynia. The word primary indicated that the patient’s 
condition was congenital (since birth). The doctor recommended a procedure called a 
vestibulectomy where he would surgically remove Kelsey’s vestibule.`,

          text: `After years of being ignored, we felt vindicated. Kelsey wasn’t alone. What she’d been 
experiencing for years had a name, and there were other women out there suffering just as she 
was.`,

        {
          type: "paragraph",
          text: `Even though I knew Kelsey had vulvodynia, we got opinions from other specialists who also 
recommended the procedure. Kelsey’s vestibule was surgically removed when she was 18. 
During the follow up appointment, tears poured down her face. For the first time in Kelsey’s life, 
the physical exam didn’t hurt. We left the doctor’s office feeling like we’d just won the lottery. 
Kelsey started taking classes at a local college and got a part-time job at a pet store. 
But the future held a cruel twist of fate we never could have imagined. About a year later, all her 
symptoms returned.`,

          text: `Kelsey had a spinal cord stimulator implanted, pudendal nerve blocks, and endured years of 
pelvic floor therapy. She even tried wearing a urine bag, but nothing worked. A doctor suggested 
that Kelsey see a neurologist and be tested for something called Small Fiber Neuropathy. I’d 
never heard of SFN and when I read about it, I was confused. The presenting symptom in three-
fourths of SFN patients was pain or burning in the feet. It was usually associated with diabetes, 
and the average age of diagnosis was 54. Kelsey was 23, didn’t have diabetes, and had never had 
pain in her feet.`,

          type: "paragraph",
          text: `The neurologist did a skin punch biopsy. About a week later, he called and said Kelsey’s biopsy 
was positive for SFN. The epidermal nerve fiber density result was 0.4 in her thigh and 1.34 in 
her calf. He then ordered dozens of lab tests because many conditions can cause SFN. When all 
the labs came back negative, doctors called Kelsey’s SFN idiopathic. Without a cause, there was 
no treatment.`,

          text: `Later I’d learn there are studies that show a connection between vulvodynia and SFN. The 
statistics vary from 5% to 38% depending on the cohort of women who test positive for SFN and 
report also having vulvodynia.`,

          text: `What I didn’t know at the time was that SFN can affect a person’s autonomic system. Even 
though Kelsey’s bladder would be full, she wouldn’t be able to start a stream of urine. 
Sometimes she’d go more than 24 hours being unable to urinate. A motility test showed that over 
a four-day period, the food that Kelsey ate barely moved through her digestive tract which 
caused severe constipation. A gastroenterologist found abnormal dilation throughout Kelsey’s 
colon. Being nauseated became commonplace, and sometimes she vomited even though she 
wasn’t truly sick. Kelsey was always too hot or too cold, never comfortable. The chronic fatigue 
she experienced was debilitating. Because her symptoms were worse at night, she’d sleep during 
the day and barely interact with people. Her hair was falling out, and her teeth were crumbling. 
Even her pancreas had atrophied, and still doctors didn’t seem concerned.`,

ENT did a barium swallow test and said her esophagus was misfiring. This newest symptom was 
also blamed on her SFN.`,

child. But for me, this was “normal.” I thought—I’ll see Kelsey in the morning.`,

autopsy said she aspirated due to severe chronic bowel obstruction with megacolon. Kelsey was 
29 years old. No doctor had ever indicated that her symptoms were life threatening or even 
worrisome. We were in complete shock that our daughter was gone.`,

to brighten their day. From the moment Kelsey left this world, I knew exactly what I needed to 
do. Brody and I became a therapy dog team in her memory. When Brody walks into a patient’s 
room, he brings them joy just as Kelsey imagined.`,
